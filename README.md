# Arxiv Daily AIGC

This is an automated project designed to fetch the latest papers from the Computer Vision (cs.CV) field on arXiv daily, use AI (currently via OpenRouter API) to filter papers related to image/video/multimodal generation, generate structured JSON data and aesthetically pleasing HTML pages, and finally automatically deploy the results to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Features

1.  **Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches the latest papers from the `cs.CV` field on arXiv daily.
2.  **AI Filtering**: Uses LLM to intelligently filter papers related to image/video/multimodal generation themes and scores the value of the papers across different dimensions.
3.  **Data Storage**: Saves the filtered paper information (title, abstract, link, etc.) as date-named JSON files (stored in the `daily_json/` directory).
4.  **Web Page Generation**: Generates daily HTML reports based on the JSON data using a preset template (stored in the `daily_html/` directory) and updates the main entry page `index.html`.
5.  **Automated Deployment**: Implements the complete process of daily scheduled fetching, filtering, generation, and deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend/Script**: Python 3.x (`arxiv`, `requests`, `jinja2`)
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS (CDN), JavaScript, Framer Motion (CDN)
*   **Automation**: GitHub Actions
*   **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## Installation

1.  **Clone Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd arxiv_daily_aigc
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    # Or .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: All required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key**: This project requires an OpenRouter API Key for AI filtering. You can also modify `src/filter.py` to use other LLM APIs. For security, do not hardcode the key in the code. Set it as an environment variable when running locally. In GitHub Actions, set it as a Secret named `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Usage

### Local Run

You can directly run the main script `main.py` to manually trigger a complete process (fetch, filter, generate).

```bash
# Ensure the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable is set
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_openrouter_api_key'

# Run the main script (processes today's papers by default)
python src/main.py

# (Optional) Run for a specific date
# python src/main.py --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

After successful execution:
*   The JSON data for the day will be saved in `daily_json/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
*   The HTML report for the day will be saved in `daily_html/YYYY_MM_DD.html`.
*   The main entry page `index.html` will be updated to include the link to the latest report.

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser to view the results.

### GitHub Actions Automation

The repository is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily_arxiv.yml`).

*   **Scheduled Trigger**: The workflow is set to run automatically at a scheduled time daily by default.
*   **Manual Trigger**: You can also manually trigger this workflow from the Actions page of your GitHub repository.

The workflow automatically completes all steps and deploys the generated `index.html`, `daily_json/`, and `daily_html/` directory files to GitHub Pages.

## Viewing Deployment Results

The project is configured to display results via GitHub Pages. Please visit your GitHub Pages URL (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`) to view the daily updated paper reports.
