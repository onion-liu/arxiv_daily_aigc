        "summary": "As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly gain traction in medical applications, clinicians are progressively expecting AI systems not only to generate textual diagnoses but also to produce corresponding medical images that integrate seamlessly into authentic clinical workflows. Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.",

        "summary": "Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.",

        "summary": "3D modeling is shifting from static visual representations toward physical, articulated assets that can be directly used in simulation and interaction. However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.",

        "summary": "Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its \"draft one step, then verify one step\" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm.",

Although recent methods for 3D LiDAR point cloud generation have shown significant improvements, they still face notable limitations, including the lack of sequential generation capabilities and the inability to produce accurately positioned foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. These shortcomings hinder their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce DriveLiDAR4D, a novel LiDAR generation pipeline consisting of multimodal conditions and a novel sequential noise prediction model LiDAR4DNet, capable of producing temporally consistent LiDAR scenes with highly controllable foreground objects and realistic backgrounds.

We evaluated DriveLiDAR4D on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets, where we achieved an FRD score of 743.13 and an FVD score of 16.96 on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, UniScene, with an performance boost of 37.2% in FRD and 24.1% in FVD, respectively.",

        "title": "MeanFlow Transformers with Representation Autoencoders",
        "summary": "MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in video generation have demonstrated the potential of using video diffusion models as world models, with autoregressive generation of infinitely long videos through masked conditioning. However, such models, usually with local full attention, lack effective memory compression and retrieval for long-term generation beyond the window size, leading to issues of forgetting and spatiotemporal inconsistencies. To enhance the retention of historical information within a fixed memory budget, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) into the diffusion transformer framework. Specifically, a diffusion model incorporating LSTM with attention achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RNN blocks, such as TTT and Mamba2. Moreover, existing diffusion-RNN approaches often suffer from performance degradation due to training-inference gap or the lack of overlap across windows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Recurrent Autoregressive Diffusion (RAD) framework, which executes frame-wise autoregression for memory update and retrieval, consistently across training and inference time. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate the superiority of RAD for long video generation, highlighting the efficiency of LSTM in sequence modeling.",

To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.",

We introduce a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to disentangle camera motion from photographic inputs, allowing fine-grained, independent control without compromising scene consistency.

Existing static pruning methods degrade performance by permanently removing weights or tokens, disrupting pretrained dependencies. To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge.

        "summary": "Generating high-quality human interactions holds significant value for applications like virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods often fail to preserve unique individual characteristics or fully adhere to textual descriptions. To address these challenges, we introduce InterMoE, a novel framework built on a Dynamic Temporal-Selective Mixture of Experts. The core of InterMoE is a routing mechanism that synergistically uses both high-level text semantics and low-level motion context to dispatch temporal motion features to specialized experts. This allows experts to dynamically determine the selection capacity and focus on critical temporal features, thereby preserving specific individual characteristic identities while ensuring high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments show that InterMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in individual-specific high-fidelity 3D human interaction generation, reducing FID scores by 9% on the InterHuman dataset and 22% on InterX.",

        "title": "TripleFDS: Triple Feature Disentanglement and Synthesis for Scene Text Editing",
        "summary": "Scene Text Editing (STE) aims to naturally modify text in images while preserving visual consistency, the decisive factors of which can be divided into three parts, i.e., text style, text content, and background. Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the \"SCB Group\", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent \"shortcut\" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS",

        "summary": "Multimodal Model Editing (MMED) aims to correct erroneous knowledge in multimodal models. Existing evaluation methods, adapted from textual model editing, overstate success by relying on low-similarity or random inputs, obscure overfitting. We propose a comprehensive locality evaluation framework, covering three key dimensions: random-image locality, no-image locality, and consistent-image locality, operationalized through seven distinct data types, enabling a detailed and structured analysis of multimodal edits. We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average.",
